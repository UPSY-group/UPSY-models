Welcome to the Utrecht Polar SYstem (UPSY) models repo! Here you will find the UPSY modelling toolkit, the
Utrecht Finite Volume Ice-Sheet Model (UFEMISM), and the One-Layer Antarctic Model for Dynamical
Downscaling of Iceâ€“Ocean Exchanges (LADDIE).

See https://github.com/UPSY-group/UPSY-models/wiki/Getting-started for how to set up your model.
